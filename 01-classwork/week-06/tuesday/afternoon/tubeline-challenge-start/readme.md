# Tube Line Challenge

We’d like you to complete a small project to assess your technical ability and design skills.

Using the TfL API, build a mobile-oriented web app that:
• Lists the London Underground lines sorted alphabetically
• Shows the current status of each line
• Updates the status every 5 minutes

Feel free to style the app as you wish, but see "example.png" below for a rough idea on what to produce. For this challenge use Sass to write the styles for your app, and use the command line to convert it to regular CSS. In the project root run the following command. Hit control + c when you would like to stop Sass watching your file

```sh
  sass styles/sass/main.scss styles/css/main.css --watch
```

Transport for London (TfL) operates the entire London Underground network and provides APIs for live status and various other data. We recommend using the tube status API (https://api.tfl.gov.uk/line/mode/tube/status) for this project.

Tips
Remember to test endpoints with Postman before attempting to use them in your code.
Do not write in the autogenerated CSS file, these are the browsers not yours!
